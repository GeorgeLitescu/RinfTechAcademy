  **Second Exercise of Homework**
  
  I implemented the required classes with all the necessary methods. I did not face any real issue.
  In the "Test.java" file i copied the given instructions and commented the ones that were wrong.
  (also, i wrote the corect sintax for the broken instructions afterwards)
