I did not manage to link 2 html pages. I researched a lot but did not find anything at least remotely similar to my situation. 
After hours of trial and error i decided to use servlets to implement the forms.

The other big issue i faced was the fileupload with overwrite. For some reason I always got a NullPointerException that made the servlet unusable.
I will continue research on these 2 issues but i could not spend any more time on this right now.
