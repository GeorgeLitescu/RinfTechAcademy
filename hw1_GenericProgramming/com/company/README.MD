    **First Exercise of Homework**
    
I started with the generic class "Pair" and tested it with basic commands
After that i implemented the also generic "PairOperations" class that has the requested methods.

I dont feel like i used the optimal solution for this situation since i had to instantiate both generic classes for each value type
