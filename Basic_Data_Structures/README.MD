    **Second Part of Homework**
    
Here are the exercices from slides 3 to 6.

For "FindCommon", i made 2 methods, as requested.

"SetOperations" implements subtract and unite. (i could have just made them in Main but i find it
easier to follow when it's spaced up)

For "LongestGrow" i did not find any premade methods so i wrote the code manually and works fine.
