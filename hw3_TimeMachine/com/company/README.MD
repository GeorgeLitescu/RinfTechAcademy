    **Third Exercise of Homework**
    
This was, in my opinion, the thoughest exercise until now. Not really because of the dificulty of it but more because of the 
intense research and troubleshooting i had to do. After all, i now have a much greater understanding over the java.time library.

I also know this code is not optimal, i think that i could have simplified it much more and also could have made it eazier to read.
I will work more on that in the future.
